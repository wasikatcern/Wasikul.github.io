Hello! I'm **Dr. Wasikul Islam**, an Experimental Particle Physicist currently affiliated with the **University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison**, as a Scientist. I also work as a Physicist at the ATLAS Experiment at the Large Hadron Collider(LHC), **CERN, Switzerland**. I am a Visiting Research Affiliate at **SLAC National Lab, Stanford University**.

My research aims to uncover new physics at the LHC by developing cutting‚Äëedge techniques and algorithms for high‚Äëenergy physics, powered by AI and machine learning.

My recent honors include the **Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics-2025 (shared with ATLAS/CERN colleagues)**, **Wisconsin Initiative for Science Literacy Award (2024)**, **Postdoc Excellence Award (2023)**, and election to **Sigma Xi Scientific Research Honor Society (2025)**. I'm an author of **600+ physics papers** and two books (1 in **physics** and 1 in **Bangla poetry**).

My journey spans:
- Ph.D. in Physics from Oklahoma State University, USA (2021)  
- Research fellowships and past positions at **Argonne National Lab**, **Fermilab**, and the **University of Wisconsin-Madiosn**.  
- B.Sc. & M.Sc. in Physics from Aligarh Muslim University, India.
