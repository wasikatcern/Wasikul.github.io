Hello! Welcome to the page! I am Dr. Wasikul Islam, an Experimental Particle Physicist, currently a Scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA, and a Physicist at the CERN laboratory in Switzerland, where I work for the ATLAS Collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). I am presently based at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, Stanford University, as a Visiting Research Affiliate.

I have been awarded the “Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics 2025” (shared with my ATLAS/CERN colleagues), “Wisconsin Initiative for Science Literacy Award (2024)”, “Postdoc Excellence Award (2023)”, among others. In 2025, I was elected a full member of 'Sigma Xi, The Scientific Research Honor Society'.

I am an author of 600+ physics research papers & the two following books :

1. A poetry book written in the Bangla language “নক্ষত্রপুঞ্জ সাক্ষী” (“Nakkhatra Punja Sakkhi”, which means “Stars are the witness”) by Manan Publication, India (ISBN: 978-93-91027-20-9).
2. “Memorial Volume for Tai Tsun Wu: A Pioneer of Mathematical and Theoretical Physics” by World Scientific Publishing (ISBN: 978-981-98-2190-7).

In the past, I have worked at the University of Wisconsin as a Postdoctoral Research Associate (2021-2024) after completing a Ph.D. in Physics from Oklahoma State University (2021). During Ph.D., I worked at the Argonne National Laboratory for 1.5 years as a recipient of "ANL-ATLAS Graduate Fellowship" & "HEPCCE Summer Fellowship", and also worked at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory for a year at its Test beam Facility. I did my B.Sc. & M.Sc. in Physics from India.
